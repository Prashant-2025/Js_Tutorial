/* Arrays in JS
    Arrays are the variables which contains more than one value.
    These are the collection of numbers, strings, objects, etc.
    Ex: const fruits = ["Banana", "Apple", "Grapes"];
    const arr = [7, "Prashant", false]; //Values of an array in JS can be of different types

    // Accessing the Values:
    let numbers = [23, 45, 34, 11, 57];
    numbers[0] -> 23
    numbers[1] -> 45
    numbers[2] -> 34
    numbers[3] -> 11

    // Finding the Length:
    let numbers = [3, 6, 4, 9];
    numbers[0] -> 3
    numbers.length -> 4

    // Changing the Values:
    let numbers = [22, 34, 56, 78, 98];
    numbers[2] = 60;
    Now numbers will become [22, 34, 60, 78, 98];
    Arrays are mutable and can be changed.

    In Javascript arrays are objects. The typeOf operator on arrays returns object.
    const n = [1, 7, 9];
    typeOf(n) -> return object
    
    Arrays can hold many values under a single name.
